      <a href='http://dogzombie.blogspot.com/2015/03/who-are-caretakers-of-dog.html'>Who funds dog research?</a>
    </h2>
    <div class='pl-date'>Wednesday, 25Mar2015</div>
    <div class='pl-content'>As I move through my training and think ahead to my future career, I wonder: who will pay for all this research I want to do on dogs? I have so many questions to ask!<br /><ul><li><i>What changes happen in the canine brain as it enters, and then leaves, the socialization period?</i></li><li><i>How is the brain of a fearful dog different from that of a confident dog?</i></li><li><i>What are the genetic differences behind these variations?</i></li><li><i>How do environmental differences (prenatal stress, early learning, adult life) change the brain?</i></li></ul>In other words, what are the <i>mechanisms</i> in the brain that differ in fearful dogs — receptors, neurotransmitters, synaptic wiring? And how can I learn about them without using invasive (painful and/or terminal) techniques?<br /><br />Who are the caretakers of Dog, the species, who care about fearfulness? We as dog owners and lovers care, but dog owners and lovers aren’t the ones who are trained to heal unhealthy dogs, to perform research aimed at understanding them, and we (mostly) aren’t the ones who breed them. So who are the groups who are the caretakers of Dog, and what subsets of Dog do they care for?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KuSo-7ge-Ts/VRLeTxJRiOI/AAAAAAAAAQo/3FV5arQKzHc/s1600/dog-inquisitive.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Image: Who is my caretaker?" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KuSo-7ge-Ts/VRLeTxJRiOI/AAAAAAAAAQo/3FV5arQKzHc/s1600/dog-inquisitive.jpg" height="183" title="" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><h3>Veterinarians</h3>We (I am a veterinarian) are trained to heal sick dogs. Relatively few veterinarians perform research compared to those who engage solely in clinical practice. But some do perform research: most commonly as faculty at veterinary schools alongside a clinical practice, or less commonly as researchers without a clinical practice at research instititutions.<br /><br />Veterinary research, as a result of this strong emphasis on healing the unhealthy, is focused on clinical results. Veterinarians most commonly perform research which asks questions about the effectiveness of particular techniques — medications, surgical approaches, new equipment. Veterinary research very rarely addresses root questions about mechanisms, particularly in the area of behavior. Rather than asking “How are the brains of fearful dogs different?”, veterinary research is more likely to ask how we could fix a fearful dog: “Does this medication make a fearful dog less fearful?” <br /><br />In fact, as I pursue my mechanism-based questions, I am asked if I miss being a veterinarian. The perception is that because I am engaged in basic, rather than clinical, research, I am no longer working as a veterinarian.<br /><br /><h3>Basic science researchers</h3><br />If veterinarians do clinical research studies, then who does basic research biomedical studies, studies that look not at how to fix problems but at how the body works? Ph.D. researchers are more likely to do this sort of research, which is why I am currently engaged in obtaining a Ph.D.<br /><br />Traditionally, Ph.D. researchers have not been interested in dogs. In fact, way back in 2004 when I was originally deciding between a Ph.D. and a D.V.M., I was told by a Ph.D. animal behaviorist, “Ph.D.s don’t study domesticated animals. Veterinarians study those.” (Actually, veterinarians mostly just try to fix unhealthy domesticated animals, not study the healthy ones.)<br /><br />That perception has changed in a big way in the intervening eleven years. There are now multiple laboratories studying dogs. But where does their funding come from — who cares enough about dogs <i>as dogs,</i> not as models for human problems, to provide the impressive funding needed for a genomics study? (The work I am doing for my Ph.D., sequencing messenger RNA, costs around $45,000.)<br /><br /><h3>The U.S. federal government</h3><br />The traditional source of funding for basic research is the federal government: the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> for health-based research and the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> for more basic research. But these two massive institutions are very much focused on human health — as they should be, as they are funded by the tax dollars of American citizens. The economy can’t support all the research American researchers would like to do, and getting an NIH or NSF grant is becoming more and more difficult as grant funding is cut. Funding to study dogs as models of human disease? Maybe, but isn’t it easier to study laboratory rodents (on which you can perform invasive studies) or work on humans directly? Funding to study dogs <i>as dogs</i>? Go lie down until it passes.<br /><br />In my experience, the small number of laboratories directly studying dogs are either studying them as models for questions about human health or evolution, operate on a shoestring budget, or have great trouble obtaining funding for what they want to do. <br /><br /><h3>Animal welfare organizations</h3>So who cares about dogs? Animal welfare organizations, some of which are national in scope and do perform research. Some major players in this field are the <a href="http://aspca.org/">American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a> (ASPCA), the <a href="http://centerforshelterdogs.org/">Center for Shelter Dogs</a> (CSD), and the <a href="http://hsus.org/">Humane Society of the United States</a> (HSUS). I am most familiar with the research coming out of the ASPCA and the CSD, and it is exciting stuff. But it is again mostly focused on applied questions: how can we help the shelter dogs in our care?<br /><br />I reviewed some of the research these two organizations have performed on how to identify and treat food aggression in shelter dogs in my story for the <i>Bark</i> on <a href="http://thebark.com/content/testing-behavior-assessment">shelter behavioral assessments</a>. This was ground-breaking research and I am really glad to see it published. But it doesn’t ask the basic (i.e., non-applied) research questions I am interested in: what is it about the brains of these dogs that differs from the brains of dogs without food aggression? That kind of research doesn’t have immediate applied benefit. You can’t take it to a shelter worker with a recommendation about whether or not to put a food aggressive dog on the adoption floor. It is incredibly impressive that these shelter-focused organizations perform any research at all, and it is absolutely appropriate that the research they perform should have a highly applied focus, with clear questions that, when answered, will provide guidance on how to improve the lives of shelter dogs, immediately. They do not have the resources to pursue these sort of mechanism questions that I want to ask, which do not have immediate applicability.<br /><br />So who cares about understanding how dog brains work, with the hope that that information will provide a base for future applied research? Who cares about the whole species, not just the subset in shelters or the subset in hospitals?<br /><br /><h3>Breed organizations</h3>Breed organizations care very much about the health and welfare of dogs, and in fact have provided funding into the mechanisms behind health issues specific to their breed. A recent paper about associations between spay/neuter status and health issues in Golden Retrievers was partially funded by the American Kennel Club’s <a href="http://www.akcchf.org/">Canine Health Foundation</a> (AKC/CHF), and a similar study on Vizslas was funded by the <a href="http://vcaweb.org/welfare/welfare.shtml">Vizsla Club of America Welfare Foundation</a>. (<a href="http://dogzombie.blogspot.com/2015/02/do-spayed-and-neutered-dogs-get-cancer.html">I blogged about these studies elsewhere</a>.)<br /><br />These organizations can fund basic research on how and why particular diseases occur in their breeds, and may even be willing to fund expensive genetic studies, such as a recent one on the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004922">genetics of cancer in Golden Retrievers</a>, supported in part by both the AKC/CHF and the <a href="http://www.goldenretrieverfoundation.org/">Golden Retriever Foundation</a>. However, their focus is very much on the problems of a particular breed. My questions are broader: why do dogs of all breeds have different personalities, some more or less fearful? These organizations are really the caretakers of breed subsets of Dog, not of Dog itself.<br /><br /><h3>Who, then?</h3>Who does that leave as a group willing to fund studies on Dog? On problems common to all breeds? On problems which may or may not provide good models for humans? If I hope to one day run a laboratory which studies these problems, who can I hope to help pay for the research?<br /><br />I would be remiss if I did not mention <a href="http://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/">Morris Animal Foundation</a> here. While their important <a href="http://caninelifetimehealth.org/">Golden Retriever Lifetime Study</a> happens to focus on the health issues of a single breed, their mission is to fund research into studies of small animals (dogs and cats), livestock, and wild animals, with no breed limitations. This group is doing important work, and I applaud them.<br /><br />But one organization is not enough for a laboratory to depend on for survival, especially in these times with research funding so hard to come by. And so I wonder: are we, the dog lovers of the world, the ones to start supporting research into what it is to be a dog? We, who own dogs of all breeds and mixes, with all sorts of problems, who know what problems most plague us as owners — not just medical problems, but behavioral ones?<br /><br />And so I leave you with my dreams of <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0110329">crowdfunding</a>, in which a researcher proposes a study and asks the public to support it through donations. Such an approach allows the dog community to take the task of answering basic questions about Dogness into their own hands. This direct connection between a researcher and the community affected by their research is a new benefit of this age of social media. Is this approach right for this particular problem? Time will tell.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lf2JPH9x5ug/VRLd8pxPp7I/AAAAAAAAAQg/3lOHyaFww2k/s1600/dog-watching.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="Image: Will crowdfunding work?" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lf2JPH9x5ug/VRLd8pxPp7I/AAAAAAAAAQg/3lOHyaFww2k/s1600/dog-watching.jpg" height="213" title="" width="320" /></a></div><br /></div>

    </h2>
    <div class='pl-date'>Wednesday,  6Aug2014</div>
    <div class='pl-content'>I am again indebted to my APDT students, who asked a very interesting question which turned into a blog post. This time it was: “Can a father’s stress be passed on epigenetically to his offspring through sperm?” Warning: epigenetic geekery ahead. If you are not in the mood for some technical terminology, this may not be the post for you.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/MiRNA.svg/1024px-MiRNA.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/MiRNA.svg/1024px-MiRNA.svg.png" height="225" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA#mediaviewer/File:MiRNA.svg">Source: Wikipedia</a></td><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I’ve blogged about epigenetics before (on the <a href="http://dogzombie.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-epigenetics-of-fear.html">epigenetics of fear</a> and of <a href="http://dogzombie.blogspot.com/2009/11/epigenetics-of-stress.html">stress</a><span id="goog_718589084"></span><span id="goog_718589085"></span>) and there are summaries of what epigenetics is in those two posts, but basically it’s changes in the DNA that don’t involve the sequence of bases. We’ve been so focused on the importance of DNA sequence as we’ve learned more and more about genetics, but in recent years the importance of other factors has started to become obvious. It’s like saying that the content of a book isn’t the only thing controlling whether the book gets read or not — it also matters whether the cover is appealing, how much it costs, and whether it’s shelved where people can find it.<br /><br />One of my students tried to answer her own question and found this fascinating article:<br /><br /><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1523%2Fjneurosci.0914-13.2013&amp;rft.atitle=Paternal+Stress+Exposure+Alters+Sperm+MicroRNA+Content+and+Reprograms+Offspring+HPA+Stress+Axis+Regulation&amp;rft.jtitle=Journal+of+Neuroscience&amp;rft.volume=33&amp;rft.issue=21&amp;rft.spage=9003&amp;rft.epage=9012&amp;rft.date=2013&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fscienceseeker.org&amp;rft.au=Rodgers+A.+B.&amp;rft.aulast=Rodgers&amp;rft.aufirst=A.+B.&amp;rft.au=+S.+L.+Bronson&amp;rft.au=+S.+Revello&amp;rft.au=+T.+L.+Bale&amp;rfs_dat=ss.included=1&amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1">Rodgers A.B.,  S.

And they had, but in some surprising ways.<br /><br /><b>The  mice</b><br /><br />Male mice were chosen because we have evidence that environmental effects can be passed on epigenetically through the sperm. Because sperm are made throughout the male’s lifetime, they can easily serve as messengers to pass information about the environment on from fathers to their offspring. Mothers can’t pass this information on through their eggs (so far as we know), because eggs are made before a female is born, and can’t easily be changed later. Of course, a mother has plenty of other chances to pass on information about the environment to her offspring: while they’re in utero and while they’re dependent on her. But for dad, sometimes he just has that one chance; he may never interact with his offspring in any other way than through the information in his sperm.<br /><br />(Why do parents want to give their offspring information about the&nbsp; environment? To let them know, at formative times in their lives, how to develop. If the world is a safe one, you don’t need a highly reactive stress system. But if it’s a dangerous place, you need your store of cortisol ready to go. It’s easiest for these sorts of developmental decisions about how to tune the stress system to be made early in development — in utero or post-natally — so that’s why parents have systems to pass the information on early, early, early.)<br /><br />Male mice, then, were chosen for this study. In addition to the control group of unstressed mice, there were two groups of stressed mice: mice who were stressed in adolescence, and mice who were stressed as adults. Epidemiological research in humans suggests that adolescence is an important time for epigenetic changes in sperm.<br /><br /><b>The stressors</b><br /><br />The males were subjected to a variety of stressors. In reading the list, I was torn between sympathy for the mice, and bemusement at the entries:<br /><i><br /></i><i>Stressors, selected because they are nonhabituating, do not induce pain,  and do not affect food or water intake, included                               the following: 36 h constant light, 15 min  exposure to fox odor,  novel object                               (marbles) overnight, 15 min restraint in a  50 ml conical tube, multiple cage changes, novel 100 dB white noise  (Sleep Machine;                               Brookstone) overnight, and saturated  bedding overnight.</i><br /><br />Wet beds! Scary white noise! Scary marbles! And yet yes, probably very stressful to a mouse, and I should not make fun.<br /><br /><b>Breeding</b><br />The males were given time to recover from the stress and then bred. They were removed from the cage as soon as they had mated with the female, which took 1-3 days, to minimize their interactions with her, so that their stress levels could not affect her.<b> </b>(However, the smart <a href="http://f1000.com/prime/718029855#eval793485516">reviewers at F1000</a> <i>[warning: not open content]</i> note that a stressed male might have been more aggressive in mating, which could cause the female to alter her care of her offspring.)<br /><br /><b>Offspring stress response</b><br />The offspring of stressed males, it turned out, had a <i>less</i> responsive stress response than the offspring of unstressed males. In other words, when these mice were stressed by being restrained in a conical tube for 15 minutes, the ones whose fathers had undergone the variety of stressors had a smaller cortisol response compared to the ones whose fathers had not been stressed. The result was almost exactly the same whether the fathers had been stressed as adolescents or as adults, which surprised the researchers<b>.</b><br /><br />Now,  if a mouse receives information from his father (or his father’s sperm, but you know what I mean) that the world he’s going to live in is a stressful place, I would have expected that that mouse would develop a <i>more</i> reactive stress system, not less. Worried that terrifying marbles or a wet bed are going to attack you at any moment? Then you had better have your stress response at the ready, right?<br /><br />The stress system is, of course, much more complicated than that. We don’t understand yet why some models of stress system dysregulation show less reactive responses and some show more reactive responses. For example, humans with depression or PTSD can both show either more or less reactive stress responses than mentally healthy humans. So what exactly does this mean for these particular mice? The next thing <i>I</i> would do is to look at their behavior. Do they <i>act</i> more stressed?<br /><br /><b>Offspring behavior</b><br />The offspring were subjected to quite a few and quite varied tests to see if their stress behaviors were different. The researchers tested things like how much the offspring startled in response to a loud sound; how fearful they were of being in a brightly lit box versus a dark box (mice feel safer in darkness); how long they struggled when suspended by their tails; and more. Really surprisingly (to me, at least), there were no behavioral differences between the offspring of the stressed fathers and the offspring of unstressed fathers, despite this significant difference in stress system responsiveness. So what does <i>that</i> mean?<br /><br />The researchers tested a bunch of other stuff that left them empty handed as well, like gene expression differences in the brains and adrenals of the different sets of mice. All nothing. But what did they find that was different? They found an epigenetic difference in the fathers’ sperm.<br /><br /><b>microRNA changes in sperm</b><br />Epigenetics is all about gene expression: determining which genes are used frequently to make their associated proteins, and which are left to lie dormant. The two best understood epigenetic mechanisms, acetylation and methylation, affect how much messenger RNA (mRNA) is transcribed from a particular gene. If there is more messenger RNA for a particular gene, then it’s easier to go the next step and make more of the protein that that gene codes for, and that gene’s expression increases. The mechanism that these researchers looked at is different. Instead of methylation and acetylation, they looked at microRNAs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroRNA">miRNA</a>) in the sperm of these mice. Where methylation and acetylation affect how much messenger RNA is generated, microRNAs attach to the messenger RNA itself after it has been created, and silence it.<br /><br />The way it works is this: since RNA is basically half of a double strand of DNA, it’s really sticky. It wants to find something that looks like its complement and stick to it. So microRNAs are little bits of RNA that stick to particular messenger RNAs. Then when the cell takes those messenger RNAs and tries to use them to make a protein — it can’t. Because there’s this microRNA stuck to it, blocking the sequence of the message. So microRNAs reduce the expression of a gene, but they do it one step later on in the  gene to protein pathway than methylation or acetylation does.<br /><br />Back to our book example, it’s like if you have a cookbook (the DNA). You copy out a recipe on a piece of paper for later use (the RNA). Then you use the recipe to make cookies (the protein). Methylation puts big rocks in front of the bookshelf so you can't get to it and get at the cookbook. Acetylation glues the pages of the book together so you can’t read it. But microRNAs are your obnoxious husband who draws in marker all over your copied recipe, so you have to go back and copy it out again. (Disclaimer: while my husband is quite capable of being obnoxious, he has never defaced any of my recipes. He has scribbled notes on the medication list for my dogs in the face of my express requests to the contrary, however. Rosie hasn’t been on ciprofloxacin for six months but it still says “cipro” on her meds list. It’s like he’s incapable of thinking ahead.)<br /><br />There is a <i>lot</i> we don’t know about microRNAs. The whole epigenetics field is like this: we are getting to the point where we can detect these changes, but we still don’t really know what they mean. So in this study, they found that 9 microRNAs were expressed at different levels in sperm of the stressed mice versus the unstressed mice. We can make some predictions, using computer algorithms, about which messenger RNAs these microRNAs were going to stick to and silence, but we don’t know for sure that that’s what they were actually going to do.<br /><br />Still, the predicted list is pretty interesting, because it contains the messenger RNA for the enzyme which controls methylation. Methylation! Another epigenetic mechanism! So is there some epigenetic chain going on here? The dad passes on microRNAs which will result in the DNA of the offspring being more or less methylated. It’s so hard to know what that means, because methylation has very different effects depending on which gene is affected, and this change is a more global change. But it’s a really intriguing finding, isn’t it?<br /><br /><b>Conclusions</b><br />This study is exciting, but I still felt a bit of disappointment as I read it. No behavior changes? Really? Is it really significant without the behavior changes? I mean, do we really <i>care</i> about stress system changes if there are no behavior changes? Of course we do, and I wonder if future studies will investigate different behaviors, or behaviors at different points in the mouse’s life, and then we’ll understand this system a little better.<br /><br />What does it mean for dogs? Of course it is immediately applicable to the question: if a male dog is stressed, will this stress affect his offspring? The answer is a nice solid maybe. In some way that we can’t really predict or define.<br /><br />But at another level, this is another step in our progress towards understanding how genes and the environment interact. Stressful situations change gene expression in the stressed individual and possibly their offspring. How, why? How can we measure it? How can we use our knowledge to help an animal who has been traumatized, or undersocialized?&nbsp;Watching the field of epigenetics unfold is so much fun: everything is new, we understand so little, but the new technologies are coming so fast that we’re learning more and more.<b></b></div>

    </h2>
    <div class='pl-date'>Tuesday, 28Oct2014</div>
    <div class='pl-content'>I was scanning the titles of new journal articles a while back, and came across one that made me think, hey, that may be about rats, but it is <i>totally</i> relevant to dogs. And then I thought, why don’t I teach a class on it? Read and interpret this really interesting journal article with a group of dog trainers and dog lovers?<br /><br />I will be teaching the class <a href="https://apdt.com/education/courses/details.aspx?cid=125">Prenatal Stress and Anti-Depressants</a> for APDT the week of November 18 (and you are invited to take it). This post will be used as reading material for it. In the class, we will talk about this article and what conclusions we can draw from it and apply to dogs. So I may not draw as many the conclusions for you in this post as I usually do; the plan is for the students to do that together in class. But it was a fascinating paper and there’s lots of good material in it, so read on if you want a conclusion-free summary of it!<br /><br /><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft_id=info%3Adoi%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.3389%2Ffnbeh.2014.00260&amp;rft.atitle=The+effects+of+sertraline+administration+from+adolescence+to+adulthood+on+physiological+and+emotional+development+in+prenatally+stressed+rats+of+both+sexes&amp;rft.jtitle=Frontiers+in+Behavioral+Neuroscience&amp;rft.volume=8&amp;rft.date=2014&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fscienceseeker.org&amp;rft.au=Pereira-Figueiredo+Ines&amp;rft.aulast=Pereira-Figueiredo&amp;rft.aufirst=In%C3%83%C2%AAs&amp;rft.au=+Juan+Carro&amp;rft.au=+Orlando+Castellano&amp;rft.au=+Dolores+E.+Lopez&amp;rfs_dat=ss.included=1&amp;rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1">Pereira-Figueiredo I.,  Juan Carro,  Orlando Castellano &amp;  Dolores E.

The authors of the article don’t provide much background on this phenomenon, but it’s an interesting one: when a mammal undergoes unusually high stress during her pregnancy, the personality of her offspring can be affected. We believe that the stress hormones rising in her bloodstream can pass through her placenta to the fetus or fetuses, and can change how their brains develop at this very early stage of life. That’s prenatal stress: stress experienced before birth.<br /><br />Part of what this paper investigates is exactly how prenatal stress affects the developing personality, because we don’t yet fully understand how this stuff works. In general, though, we expect prenatally stressed animals to be more anxious and less confident than animals who were not prenatally stressed.<br /><br />Does prenatal stress affect dogs? We don’t know for sure, but we think it is something that can affect most or all mammals. Would it happen commonly? Hard to say, but I imagine a pregnant dog who is stray or in a shelter and highly stressed, and I wonder what effects this might have on her puppies.<br /><br /><b>What can you do about it?</b> <br />If you have a puppy that you believe was  prenatally stressed and whose personality you thought was adversely affected, what are your options? Careful socialization and good enrichment are always an excellent choice, but in some cases you might consider medication. This study looks at whether a particular anti-depressant, sertraline, might help change the individual’s personality long-term if given in adolescence. Sertraline is an SSRI, in the same class of medications as Prozac. These are widely used medications believed to be fairly safe, but one of the questions these researchers ask is whether it is safe when given throughout an animal’s entire adolescence.<br /><br />SSRIs such as sertraline affect the levels of serotonin in your brain. Serotonin is a chemical which affects mood; depressed people tend to have less of it, as do aggressive people. As a result, it is the target of a fair number of anti-depressants, which work to increase its levels. Prenatal stress is known to disrupt the serotonin system in the brain, so a medication which affects serotonin is a reasonable choice for prenatally stressed individuals.<br /><br />So the idea is: give these prenatally stressed animals a medication which increases their serotonin levels while they are adolescents and their brains are still developing. The hope is that they will develop into more normal adults than they would have without the medication. So, exactly how do you investigate such a question?<br /><br /><b>Methods: how the study worked</b><br />First, the researchers stressed some pregnant rats by putting them in clear tubes to restrain them, and shining bright light on them. This was repeated for forty-five minutes at a time, three times a day.<b> </b>They also kept control rats, who were not stressed during their pregnancy. The pups born to these two sets of rats were then in two categories: prenatally stressed pups and non-stressed pups.<br /><br />The rat pups began their anti-depressant treatment with sertraline when they were one month old. Now there were four groups of rat pups:<br /><br /><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>prenatal stress<br />anti-depressants</td>    <td>prenatal stress<br />no anti-depressants</td></tr><tr><td>no prenatal stress<br />anti-depressants</td>    <td>no prenatal stress<br />no anti-depressants</td></tr></tbody></table><br />Having these four groups allowed the researchers to pick apart the two different effects, the effect of prenatal stress and the effect of anti-depressants during adolescence.<br /><br />The pups were tested at two months of age, the beginning of rat adolescence,  to see if the prenatal stress had affected their personalities. They were  assessed for how they dealt with startling noises and being exposed to open space (scary for a rat!). Their blood was also tested to see how their immune systems were developing, because immune systems develop differently in animals who have been subjected to high stress. All these tests were run again one month later, at the end of rat adolescence, to see how the anti-depressant given throughout adolescence had affected treated rats compared to the control groups.<br /><br /><b>Results: what they found</b><br /><br /><ul><li>Although we may think of prenatal stress as mostly affecting an animal’s behavior, it’s been shown to also affect metabolism, so this study looked at birth weight. Interestingly, prenatal stress only reduced the birth weight of the female rat pups, not the males. The weights of these females had equalized compared to non-stressed pups by weaning age. After weaning, though, the prenatally stressed females continued to gain weight and ended up heavier as adults than the non-stressed females. When prenatally stressed females were given the anti-depressant sertraline, however, this weight difference was reduced.</li><li>The pups were also tested for their startle response when they heard a sudden sound. Prenatally stressed rat pups did seem to have a larger startle amplitude (size) compared to controls, but this wasn’t statistically significant, and was not reversed by sertraline treatment.</li><li>Prenatally stressed females did not habituate to the startling sound after several exposures as well as rats from other groups did; treatment with sertraline reversed this effect.</li><li>The pups’ behavior in an open space was tested. No difference was seen between prenatally stressed and non-stressed pups, except in males on their first time being tested (not on later tests).</li><li>In the open space test,  only non-stressed females explored more (became more confident) on repeated testing; males and prenatally stressed females did not become more confident with repeated exposure to the open space.</li><li>The pre-natally stressed rats showed a significant decrease in their number of white blood cells. This change was reversed when they were treated with sertraline.</li></ul><b>Discussion: what does it all mean?</b><br />The study’s main conclusions are that effects of prenatal stress can be seen in rats, and that giving sertraline during adolescence did not harm them.<br /><br />The rapid weight gain in the pre-natally stressed females is an effect that’s been seen before, and seen in humans. Children born with low birth weights often grow to have issues with their weight and can suffer from diseases related to a poorly regulated metabolism. This loss of control of energy balance has been associated with dysregulation of serotonin in humans, adding additional support to the choice of sertraline, an anti-depressant which interacts with the serotonin system.<br /><br />It is interesting that no anxiety-like behavioral changes were seen in the prenatally stressed rats. Prenatal stress is known to cause anxious personalities in many cases. However, these rats were as confident (or as anxious!) in the open space test as rats who had not been prenatally stressed. The researchers comment that this particular test has been done on prenatally stressed rats in other studies, and that those rats didn’t show anxiety in the open space test either, so this does seem to be a real result, rather than a statistical error.<br /><br />They did see some differences, though. Male rats who had been prenatally stressed did show some additional reluctance to explore (i.e. anxiety) on their <i>first day only</i> in the open space test. After that they explored equal amounts compared to other groups. <br /><br />The researchers also note that while most of the rats that they tested were equally anxious on all days that they were tested in the open space, females who had not been prenatally stressed appeared to begin to explore more on repeated tests, as if they were learning to be less anxious as their surroundings became more familiar. This was not the case in male rats or in rats who had been pre-natally stressed.<br /><br />Remember also that female rats who were prenatally stressed did not habituate to startling sounds as well as rats from other groups. Is it possible that with this particular model of prenatal stress, the personality effects of prenatal stress appear not as classical anxiety, but as difficulty habituating to new situations or stressors such as loud noises?<br /><br />Finally, the researchers looked at effects of pre-natal stress on the immune system, and found significant effects (decreased numbers of white blood cells) which were reversed by treatment with the anti-depressant sertraline. Why did they care about the immune system? Because the immune system and the stress system are closely intertwined. Stressed animals show changes in the numbers of their white blood cells just as the prenatally stressed rats did. The researchers were using the changes in the immune system as markers for changes in the stress system.<br /><br />There are two possibilities for why these prenatally rats showed stress-associated changes in their immune systems: either because they themselves had high stress levels, or because their immune systems were developing prenatally (in utero) in a high stress environment due to their mother’s stress levels. Either way, it is interesting that treatment with sertraline reversed these effects, suggesting that it may have either changed current stress levels in these adolescent rats (even though the only serious stressors they had undergone were before their birth!), or had counteracted other effects from that prenatal stressor.<br /><br /><br /><b>Conclusions</b><br />It can be hard to know exactly what conclusions to draw from a scientific paper. What do you think? What are the most important findings in this paper (maybe just two or three of them)? Do you think those findings are real phenomena, or maybe just statistical mistakes? If they’re real, do you think they can be extrapolated from rats to humans or dogs?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class='pl-content'>“You're checked all the way through to... some place I can't pronounce,” said the woman who was checking me in at my small local airport in Illinois.<br /><br />Novosibirsk. It is the third largest city in Russia, located in south-western Siberia. It is the location of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novosibirsk_State_University">Novosibirsk State University</a>, one of the best universities in Russia, where the <a href="http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/en">Institute of Cytology and Genetics</a> maintains Belyaev’s tame foxes.<br /><br />(You may already know about the fox domestication project, but if you don’t, Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox">good primer</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/09/06/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/">Jason Goldman has written about them.</a>)<br /><br />The Institute is actually in Academic City (Akademgorodok), a suburb of Novosibirsk. Academic City is an odd blend of the European — my hotel would not have been out of place in France — and the Russian, with its thick stands of birch and fir. During my early April visit, there was still three or four feet of packed snow on the ground, and mud season was commencing as the temperature rose.<br /><br />The Institute is in a green-roofed building shoulder-by-shoulder with other university institutes. The farm, where the foxes live, is a ten or fifteen minute drive out of the city. I went to the farm daily to study the socialization period in tame and aggressive fox kits.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-klM59kgeAsM/VSwM-7oC-5I/AAAAAAAAARE/EsN8-KSazI8/s1600/foxlet2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-klM59kgeAsM/VSwM-7oC-5I/AAAAAAAAARE/EsN8-KSazI8/s1600/foxlet2.jpg" height="179" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tame fox kit (silver color)</td></tr></tbody></table><br />I was working with these kits at three weeks of age, before they were old enough to start venturing out of the nest and interacting with the world. At this point they shouldn’t yet have entered their socialization period. Yet you could already tell the difference between the tame kits and the aggressive kits. Kits within a group weren’t identical in behavior: some complained about being restrained, some yelled, some fell asleep, some were calm and silent. However, the aggressive foxes tended to make more noise, and the tame foxes tended to be more curious about their surroundings. Two aggressive fox kits tried to bite. One tame kit did.<br /><br />As for the adults, I found more behavioral variation than I’d expected there as well, although the head of the laboratory where I work had warned me again and again that the foxes vary sigificantly in behavior. Tame foxes were curious and wanted to interact with us, but some were shy, diving into their nest boxes or to the far side of their cage and then returning slowly. One fox stretched his body out, low to the ground, so that he could sniff my companion’s face without having to commit himself to coming too close. (When I offered to let him sniff my face, he stole my hat and then carried it around his cage while the neighboring foxes watched in fascination.)<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U7_3VnahZes/VSxcomRzKzI/AAAAAAAAARU/UgWDlTl6L_A/s1600/gwhite.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-U7_3VnahZes/VSxcomRzKzI/AAAAAAAAARU/UgWDlTl6L_A/s1600/gwhite.jpg" height="179" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Slightly shy tame fox (Georgian white color)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Other tame foxes could not contain their enthusiasm at having people to interact with. They rolled on their backs and made excited yipping noises and wagged their tails. In their joy, they would hold our hands gently in their mouths, something I saw again and again with them but that I have very rarely seen a dog do.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-plR1av0V6uI/VSxc5dd9-lI/AAAAAAAAARc/V_3Y6RdjLg4/s1600/handbite.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-plR1av0V6uI/VSxc5dd9-lI/AAAAAAAAARc/V_3Y6RdjLg4/s1600/handbite.jpg" height="320" width="180" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Fox holding my hand in his mouth (platinum color)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />I visited foxes from the control line, who had not been bred for behavior. They were simply afraid of us: when their cage door was opened, they retreated. If cornered, they would bite, but any aggression they showed was entirely defensive.<br /><br />I also saw foxes from the line that has been selected for aggression to humans. Some of them were afraid and aggressed only defensively. Some were more scary, coming forward to the front of the cage to bite again and again. Certainly they were afraid of humans, but something in their brains or hormones makes them more proactive and less passive in their defensive aggression.<br /><br />Finally, I met rats and mink selected for tameness or aggression. The tame rat that I met was happy to be held and happy to interact with me, but I don’t have enough experience with pet rats to say if this was unusual. The aggressive rat that I met was terrifying, hurling herself at a gloved hand when her cage door was opened and screaming repeatedly, even after we backed off.<br /><br />The tame mink were less curious than the tame foxes and didn’t seek interaction with humans in the same way. One let himself be held by his keeper but I wasn't allowed to touch him, in case he might try to bite.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p3y2rT_CWi4/VSxdrM6QV7I/AAAAAAAAARk/Fc8w9XjTsw8/s1600/brownmink.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p3y2rT_CWi4/VSxdrM6QV7I/AAAAAAAAARk/Fc8w9XjTsw8/s1600/brownmink.jpg" height="320" width="305" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tame mink</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Notice the little white patch on his chin — more white coloration is associated with more tameness in both minks and foxes. Another, all-white mink was tamer and I could pet him. He seemed deeply passive, not seeking interaction, just tolerating it.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KWi6WnjRLU4/VSxeXktKaZI/AAAAAAAAARs/OyGE3AZm9LA/s1600/whitemink.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KWi6WnjRLU4/VSxeXktKaZI/AAAAAAAAARs/OyGE3AZm9LA/s1600/whitemink.jpg" height="277" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tame white mink</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />Remember that part of the tame fox story — that as the foxes were selected for tame behavior, they started showing characteristics typical of domesticated species, including white patches and curled tails? Only a small percentage of the tame animals have these features, but I saw several piebald fox kits:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VpbhVJIh8OQ/VSxe3Vama-I/AAAAAAAAAR0/KF6kxwuYiPQ/s1600/foxlet-piebald2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VpbhVJIh8OQ/VSxe3Vama-I/AAAAAAAAAR0/KF6kxwuYiPQ/s1600/foxlet-piebald2.jpg" height="180" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Piebald fox kit (silver color)</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br />...and my host kindly pointed out one fox with a gorgeous example of a curled tail.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BqPpqLMSiGU/VSxfCP1YUtI/AAAAAAAAAR8/N6v3y1CsewQ/s1600/curledtail.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BqPpqLMSiGU/VSxfCP1YUtI/AAAAAAAAAR8/N6v3y1CsewQ/s1600/curledtail.jpg" height="180" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Fox with curled tail</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br />What an amazing week.

    </h2>
    <div class='pl-date'>Tuesday, 13Jan2015</div>
    <div class='pl-content'>I was in Boston, seeing some old friends. My dogs were two hours away in Connecticut, with the friend I was staying with. My shy dog Jenny had been doing so well, really relaxing around my friend. So I wasn't prepared when my friend called me. “How far away are you? You need to come back right now. Jenny ran away.”<br /><br />My husband and I were in the car in a few minutes, heading back to Connecticut. It wasn’t going to be a good scene when we got there. Jenny had slipped out of the door and bolted, and had disappeared. I suspected she wouldn’t come to anyone but me, and worried that she would be so scared that she wouldn’t come to me either. When we finally arrived, I walked around and called for her for an hour, but she didn’t come. She was gone.<br /><br />Jenny was gone for four days before we got her back. This is what we did:<br /><br /><ul><li>Called professionals. We went to <a href="http://www.missingpetpartnership.org/">Missing Pet Partnership</a> and looked at their <a href="http://www.missingpetpartnership.org/lost-pet-help/find-a-pet-detective/pet-detective-directory/">directory</a> to find a local non-profit that specializes in finding lost pets. We called <a href="http://www.summitsmarteam.org/">SMART</a> because they were located nearby, and they were incredibly helpful. They came out with their tracker dog and got us a lot of information about where Jenny had been, which helped us figure out where to put our posters. They gave excellent advice and provided emotional support when I felt that I was starting to crumble.</li><li>Postered. SMART emphasized that posters should be visible from cars, should be big (bigger than 8.5 x 11!), and brightly colored. They provide <a href="http://www.summitsmarteam.org/#!posters/cxob">detailed instructions</a>.</li><li>Used Facebook. The local Animal Control Officer posted a photo of Jenny on Facebook, and we let the neighborhood group for the place where we were staying know so that they could share it.</li><li>Stayed in close touch with local Animal Control Officers. I was very lucky to be staying with a friend who is the medical director at a local shelter, so she had relationships with them already.</li></ul>The community response was amazing. On the morning of Jenny’s fourth day lost, we got a phone call in response to the Facebook post. Jenny was in the caller’s yard. My husband and I left in the middle of breakfast and drove over. (We would realize around dinnertime that we had never gotten around to brushing our teeth that day.) We saw her — for the first time in four days! She didn’t come when I called her, and we lost her again. But then the phone calls started coming one after the other, some in response to Facebook, some in response to our posters. We marked her progress on a map as we followed the calls; she was travelling fast. We finally caught up with her just before dark, thanks to the Animal Control Officer who saw her but did not chase her, and stayed to point out to us where she had gone.<br /><br />In perhaps the most amazing part of the entire story, Jenny, the dog who is so afraid of men, came when my husband called, walking right up to him and licking his hand. I was a block away at the time.<br /><br />The next day, as we were walking around taking down posters, someone opened her window and called down to me from a second story room: “I’m so glad you got your dog back! I saw it on Facebook.” The Facebook post about our reunion got over 250 likes. Jenny was a local celebrity. <br /><br />The most important advice we got from SMART was to use all the options you have to communicate to the community that your dog is missing: social media, traditional posters, calling ACOs, walking the street and talking to people. Get the word out any way you can!

Veterinarians to the Rescue!</a> Did you know that veterinary superheroes have x-ray vision and use it to diagnose leptospirosis? Did you know that some of them (us? can I say some of us?) even have microscopic vision so that they can see microbes and diagnose infection with West Nile Virus? Why didn't I get these super powers when I graduated?<br /><br />My favorite scene bar none is the one in which the doctor (that is doctor-of-humans not doctor-of-animals) says "I'm just glad the veterinarian was around to help link the cause of the disease." Words spoken by <i>no doctor ever.</i> More fantastical than teleporting veterinarians?<br /><br />The point of the comic is to leave it lying around in veterinary waiting rooms for small children to pick up, so that they learn a) some of the alternate careers vets can have besides working as small animal clinicians and b) that veterinary medicine isn't just about helping animals, it's about helping people, too. (OneHealth to the rescue! I want a super hero named OneHealth Man!)<br /><br />I like this effort by the AVMA to communicate some important information about veterinary careers, but I do wonder if a somewhat heavy-handed comic is the best way to do it. You're not going to get a lot of bang for your buck with it (although on the other hand it probably didn't cost all that many bucks to produce, relatively). Hey, AVMA, are you listening to me? (AVMA reps have commented on my blog posts in the past when I've made enough noise, so consider my voice raised now.) I have an idea.<br /><br />Did you see the recent SyFy show Helix? Which actually starred a veterinary pathologist, and yet didn't do a great job of portraying what veterinary pathology is really like or why it's an exciting career. I think the AVMA, if they are serious about this goal of getting the public to better understand what veterinarians are capable of, should be trying to get more veterinarian characters on TV shows and in movies, and make sure they are well characterized. I suggest one way to do it is to offer a liaison service to Hollywood: the AVMA would provide a veterinarian consultant appropriate for the particular role, and would pay their salary and expenses for the job. The consultant would help the writers make the role realistic.<br /><br />I'm completely serious about this: I think Hollywood (or part of it) is starting to realize that a realistic depiction of scientists is something its audience is actually interested in, but it's got to be hard to find someone who can speak to the daily life of a veterinary pathologist. Make it easy for them. Because a favorite character on a TV show is something that makes kids, and even adults, consider their future career options in a different light, not a comic book with a clunky story.<br /><br /></div>

I can own a series of Golden Retrievers and predict with fair accuracy how each of them will look and act. (Look more than act, but the incredible variety of dog personalities is a story for another day.) Unfortunately, I can also predict with fair accuracy what diseases each of those dogs will have, because with the Golden looks and personality come the Golden genetic disorders. As a new dog owner years ago, I thought of these genetic problems as part of the package I was handed when I got a purebred dog: you choose the looks and personality, and you choose the diseases at the same time. But there’s a lot more to the story of how dog breeds came to be saddled with particular genetic disorders than just happenstance: we made choices when we created breeds and we continue to make choices about their health today.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iHHwODEwGvQ/VITKmXzVu9I/AAAAAAAAANQ/n474iV8Y_uA/s1600/nature08837-f1.2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iHHwODEwGvQ/VITKmXzVu9I/AAAAAAAAANQ/n474iV8Y_uA/s1600/nature08837-f1.2.jpg" height="298" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Figure from: Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication <i>Nature</i>, Vol. 464, No. 7290.

Lohmueller, et al.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><br /><b>The beginning of dog breeds</b><br />Humans have been breeding dogs for thousands of years, but for most of our history with them, function was more important than appearance. Dogs were bred to work, and beauty was a side effect: long coats were for keeping warm, small size was for chasing tunneling vermin, long legs were for speed.<br /><br />During the Victorian era, things changed, with the spectacular growth of dog fancy. Suddenly people were breeding and showing dogs for how they looked, not how they worked. Breeds were no longer loose groups of dogs who looked kind of similar and did a particular job; now for the first time purebred dogs had carefully maintained pedigrees. This was the era when the breed books closed, meaning that breeds were suddenly defined as the set of dogs whose ancestors belonged to a select list. If you wanted to make more Golden Retrievers, you could only breed dogs descended from that original list. If you bred in dogs with unknown ancestry, their offspring were considered mutts and could not be competitively shown, even if they looked just like purebreds.<br /><br />What happens when you take a relatively small set of dogs and use them to breed a much larger number of dogs? It’s like this small set of dogs is marooned on a desert island with no way to bring in new genetic diversity, and their pedigrees are what marooned them. Their descendants will look like them and act like them – and have their genetic diseases. The genetics from those few founders are all that's available to the descendants. When this reduced genetic diversity is severe, it can be a big problem.<br /><br /><b>Basenjis and Fanconi syndrome</b><br />Reduced genetic diversity is severe in the Basenji breed. This breed originated in Africa, but only the Basenjis descended from a small number of dogs imported to Europe in the 1930s are considered purebred. The diversity in this breed was so low in Basenjis in the Western world that in 1990, one in ten Basenjis suffered from exactly the same genetic disorder, a kidney disease called Fanconi syndrome. One or a few of the founding dogs must have had this disease, and it was passed on to their descendants until a large percentage of Basenjis suffered from it.<br /><br />The solution: bring in new Basenjis from Africa, breed them to the Western Basenjis, and declare that their offspring may be considered purebred, despite a lack of pedigree.&nbsp; This was done in 1990 and again in 2013, and the effects are still spreading through the Western Basenji population over several generations. (You can read about the <a href="http://www.dibubasenjis.com/congo10.htm">trip to the Congo to acquire African Basenjis</a>.)<br /><br /><b>Dalmatians and urinary tract stones</b><br />But what if there isn't an ancestral population waiting to be harvested? Dalmatians also suffer from a genetic kidney disease, in their case stones in their urinary tract caused by high levels of uric acid. It's a painful disease and there was no way to breed out of it: at one point, every single Dalmatian in existence had uric acid levels above normal canine values.<br /><br />The solution? The <a href="http://www.luadalmatians.com/">Dalmatian Backcross Project</a>, which began in 1973 with the breeding of a Dalmatian to a Pointer. The project husbanded along a line of Low Uric Acid (LUA) Dalmatians, also known as Normal Uric Acid Dalmatians, because what's low in a Dalmatian is normal in any other breed. Puppies from this original Dalmatian/Pointer cross were tested for uric acid levels, and those with normal levels were bred to purebred Dalmatians. This continued generation after generation until a line of Dalmatians had been bred which looked like Dalmatians, not Pointers, but had normal uric acid levels. As of 2011, LUA Dalmatians have been registered with the American Kennel Club and are now considered purebred Dalmatians. It remains to be seen how long the problem of high uric acid levels will remain common in this breed, but at least now there’s a solution in sight.<br /><br /><b>What we're doing about genetic health in dog breeds</b><br />With these success stories, you’d think the problem would be solved. But these are the only two breeds so far to open their breed books to bring in new genetic diversity. <i>[ETA: readers note that a few other breeds have opened their books, including Border collies, Chinooks, Salukis, and Azawakh in the US, and several breeds in Europe. Fantastic!] </i>Both the Dalmatian and the Basenji had easy to diagnose, easy to understand health problems that were also easy to identify with genetic testing: problems controlled by a single gene. Such diseases are relatively unusual. Take the case of the Golden Retriever, who is prone to developing cancer at greatly accelerated rates compared to most other breeds. Cancer is controlled by a lot of genes and is very hard to genetically test for – and therefore hard to breed away from. <br /><br />While introducing new genetics into Golden Retrievers is very likely to improve the health of the breed, it’s hard to convince breeders to take the leap. As was the case with the Dalmatian Backcross Project, such an undertaking would mean producing dogs that didn't look like Goldens for a few generations. They could still make great pets, but they couldn’t be shown and they probably couldn't be sold for as much money as a purebred. And there’s no guarantee that their descendants could ever be registered as purebreds – the fight to get LUA Dalmatians accepted was long and hard. I use Goldens as an example because I live with one, but many of the breeds we love suffer from low genetic diversity and associated genetic health concerns.<br /><br />I believe we need as a society to get past our obsession with historical breeds. We can breed for appearance, but that has to take a back seat to breeding for health. We have a model with the Dalmatian Backcross Project. All we need is the will to improve the genetic health of more breeds.<br /><br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-26OzvrlWj30/VITHsxIxIoI/AAAAAAAAANE/iwjwsZsbmxw/s1600/Jack2013.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-26OzvrlWj30/VITHsxIxIoI/AAAAAAAAANE/iwjwsZsbmxw/s1600/Jack2013.jpg" height="202" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Jack the Pumpkin King, my 14 year old Golden Retriever.

(The group is the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants, <a href="http://iaabc.org/">IAABC</a>.) These highly-skilled behavior consultants are knowledgeable in how to deal with behavior problems in dogs and other species, rather than focusing on basic obedience or competition skills like agility. <br /><br />As you may already know, the modern dog training world can be described as split into two factions: those who advocate methods using dominance theory and/or force, such as alpha rolls or leash popping, and those who advocate methods using learning theory and specifically operant conditioning, such as clicker training.The behavior consultants on this list all fall solidly into the latter category, and all agree that the basis of training should not be founded on punishment-based techniques. They are hashing out the question: Is it <i>ever</i> appropriate to use aversives in training a dog?<br /><br /> Because the two factions split mainly on the use of punishment, it can be easy to fall into black-and-white thinking and assume that <i>any</i> aversive is unacceptable, and equate all aversives with pain and fear. But does “aversive” necessarily mean “painful”?<br /><br />An aversive is something unpleasant. Give an animal something pleasant (a treat) and it will be more likely to repeat whatever behavior it most recently offered (sitting down). Give an animal something unpleasant (a tug on a prong collar) and it will be less likely to repeat whatever behavior it most recently offered (lunging at a passing dog). Both techniques work in getting the desired behavior. Techniques using an aversive stimulus may have side effects, however — in this example, a dog who lunges at passing dogs out of fear may learn to associate pain from the prong collar with other dogs. While he may stop lunging, he is likely to develop other unwanted behaviors, like biting when the other dog approaches close enough.<br /><br />Pain and fear are absolutely aversives, and I think everyone in this discussion is agreed that pain and fear should be avoided — that some aversives are just too aversive to use. Many trainers in the discussion declare that they would never use a shock collar; some say they might, but only under extreme circumstances, after many other approaches have been tried and failed. Where do you draw the line at “too aversive,” though? That’s a very interesting question, and different trainers have different answers. But can you be a trainer who works in the positive training camp, and still sometimes uses aversives? For sure.<br /><br />And here’s the thing: it’s the dog who determines what’s aversive. So some tools that we think of as very mild, like a head halter, can end up being quite aversive for some dogs. A head halter — that’s nothing like a prong collar or a shock collar or a choke chain, and it doesn’t hurt the dog at all. But it is (according to many dogs, including one of mine) incredibly annoying to have on your nose. Is it aversive? Yes. Is it inhumane? That’s an awfully strong word for such an innocuous device. But if you use a head halter on your dog, you are not engaging in 100% positive training. You are using a (mild) aversive. Not one that probably involves pain or fear, but an aversive all the same.<br /><br />And it turns out it’s pretty difficult to train successfully using no aversives at all! Even telling a dog “that wasn’t the right choice” by using a marker like “oops!” during your training can be a mild aversive. Is it okay to train with mild aversives? Everyone has to answer that question for themself, but from my perspective, of course it is. Life has its ups and downs and everyone is going to encounter mild obstacles from time to time, even a pampered dog. The question is how big an aversive you want to throw at your dog, where exactly you draw the line between acceptable and not. That line will be drawn differently for every owner and every trainer.<br /><br />So when you’re choosing a new trainer for your dog, remember that some will advertise that they use 100% positive methods, but they may not have quite thought through the implications of all of their methods. Others may state that they’re not 100% positive, but that they still use mostly positive methods — and that’s okay. As your dog’s owner and advocate, it’s up to you to talk to your potential new trainer about their methods, discover what kinds of aversives they do use, and decide what’s acceptable for your dog. Just work through the language your trainer uses to make sure that the kinds of aversives they use are at a level that’s acceptable to you, and of course make sure that they use scientifically-based learning theory (look for words like “positive reinforcement” and avoid words like “alpha” and “dominant”). As a dog loving community, we can agree that the use of aversives should be minimized, while still accepting that from time to time it’s okay to use mild ones.</div>

    <div class='pl-date'>Thursday, 16Oct2014</div>
    <div class='pl-content'>I haven’t been blogging much lately, and it’s mostly because I’ve been writing so much for more mainstream media outlets:<br /><ul><li>“Neutering without a Scalpel” in the summer issue of the <a href="http://www.whole-dog-journal.com/"><i>Whole Dog Journal</i></a>. This story was about Zeuterin, a new product for performing chemical castration on a dog — in other words, non-surgical neutering. I tried to cover all the possible pros and cons of using Zeuterin versus the traditional surgical approach. I don’t think either solution is going to be right for every dog or every situation, and it’s nice to see new options coming out.</li><li>“Testing the Tests“ in the fall issue of <a href="http://thebark.com/content/magazine">The Bark</a>. I read <i>so many</i> journal articles about canine behavioral assessments (also known as temperament tests) for this piece. You know, the tests that are often used in shelters to try to identify behavior problems in dogs before they’re put up for adoption. It was fascinating reading and ended up telling an interesting story about researchers’ attempts to figure out whether behavioral assessments are good at predicting canine behavior. The answer: not really, but some new research approaches have appeared recently which have shed a lot of light on how to interpret these tests and how to approach building better tests.</li><li>I’ve also been writing for <a href="http://www.dvm360.com/">DVM360</a> (I have two pieces going through the pipeline there right now, one about shelters and one about stress), I have another piece pending for the Whole Dog Journal, a guest post for a new dog site, and you already know about my upcoming ultra short, ultra fun <a href="http://dogzombie.blogspot.com/2014/10/journal-articles-stress-and-anti.html">online class for APDT</a>, right?</li></ul>So with all of that, I haven’t been blogging much, but I keep thinking about it and missing it. I figured I should at least report here on where to find me. </div>

    <div class='pl-content'>I’m teaching another online course for APDT: <span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://apdt.com/education/courses/details.aspx?cid=125">Analyzing Journal Articles: Pre-Natal Stress and Anti-Depressants.</a> I’m trying something new with this one. It's just one week long. Basically, I’m going to be walking through a recent journal article that I thought had interesting implications for dogs. There will be several short lectures at different experience levels. Some will provide background in the area to students who don’t have an extensive science background. Some will be aimed at students who do know a lot of science and want to dig deeper into stuff that isn’t often covered in online courses. And some will be straightforward “what is this article about?”</span><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: normal;">It's an interesting article, about whether stress before birth can affect an animal’s personality and whether anti-depressant medication change reverse those effects. Hopefully it isn’t hard to see how this could be relevant to dogs with behavior issues.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;">If we don't get at least ten students signed up, we won’t do it, so go sign up now! You will get CE! If people do sign up and do enjoy it, I’m hoping to do more like this -- providing a way for dog trainers to keep up on recent research and get a better feel for what it’s like to read a scientific paper. So this is my test case. Will people be interested? I really hope so!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>[ETA: Although the last time I checked, the <a href="https://apdt.com/education/courses/details.aspx?cid=125">APDT web page for this class</a> lists it as "no CEUs," I checked with their education coordinator, and students completing this class will earn 4 CEUs. So yes, you will get CEU credit for it!]</i> </span></div>
